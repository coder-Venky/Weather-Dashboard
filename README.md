# Weather Dashboard

## Introduction
The **Weather Dashboard** is a Python-based application that provides real-time weather updates for any location. It fetches weather data from an API and displays essential weather parameters, such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and conditions.

## Features
- Fetches real-time weather data
- Displays temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions
- Supports multiple locations
- User-friendly interface with graphical visualization (if using Tkinter/Flask)
- Uses API-based data retrieval

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (Primary language)
- **OpenWeatherMap API** (For weather data)
- **Requests** (For API calls)
- **Tkinter / Flask** (For UI, if applicable)
- **Matplotlib** (For data visualization, optional)

## Installation Guide
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-dashboard.git
   cd weather-dashboard
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Configure the OpenWeatherMap API key in `config.py`.
4. Run the application:
   ```sh
   python weather_dashboard.py
   ```

## How to Use
1. Enter a city name to fetch the current weather data.
2. The dashboard will display:
   - Temperature (°C/°F)
   - Weather conditions (sunny, cloudy, rainy, etc.)
   - Humidity percentage
   - Wind speed
3. Optionally, you can extend the application to display a **5-day weather forecast**.

## Configuration Details
- **API Setup**: Get an API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) and add it to `config.py`.
- **UI Customization**: Modify `weather_dashboard.py` to change the interface and add more features.
